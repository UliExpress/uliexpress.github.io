# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Website is done. Just polishing up some things.

# Changelog:
## Update 1.01 (6/28/24): Made light mode on site use system default first unless manually set using light toggle.
## Update 1.01.1 (6/28/24): Added variety of images for the heading, different city each page and changes with light toggle.
## Update 1.01.9 (6/28/24): Removed horizontal scrolling on desktop + mobile, but now there's awkward space on the right hand side of mobile screens.
